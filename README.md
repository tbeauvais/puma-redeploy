# Puma::Redeploy

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/puma/redeploy`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run the following. **Note** - You must add any new files to git 

```text
bundle exec rake install
puma-redeploy 0.1.0 built to pkg/puma-redeploy-0.1.0.gem.
puma-redeploy (0.1.0) installed.
```

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
